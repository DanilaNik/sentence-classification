# Sentence emotional classification

This Jupyter Lab files form pipeline for creating sentence emotional classification. It tokenizes words in a sentence, after that it can be taught with .csv dataset for any language (but without knowing context for single word).

Neural network model in this project uses bagging ensemble to raise accuracy for classification.

Model achitecture is built with keras and sklearn.

Still in progress
